# ðŸ¤– AgentCLI â€“ AI Agents in Your Terminal

AgentCLI is a modular command-line tool that allows users to interact with powerful AI agents directly from their terminal. Built around the **Gemini API** by Google, AgentCLI enables smart interaction with local documents (like PDFs, text files, and markdown), allowing users to extract actionable insights, answer questions, and perform task-based automation â€” all with zero reliance on heavyweight frameworks like LangChain.

## ðŸ§  Project Idea

AgentCLI is designed as a lightweight and extensible CLI framework for **developing and running AI agents**. Each agent is built to handle a specific category of task using:

- **Geminiâ€™s generative capabilities for text understanding and reasoning**
- **Custom function calls to perform real-world actions**
- **Semantic search and retrieval over local files (RAG)**

The user runs agents using simple commands like:

```bash
python agentcli.py run ReminderAgent --file report.pdf
python agentcli.py run TutorAgent --file notes.md --level beginner
python agentcli.py ask FileAgent "Whatâ€™s the due date for the project?" --file tasks.txt
